# Moments App

# Moments

Moments is a feature that helps managers quickly discover and plan meaningful activities for their teams.

The goal of the app is simple: **make it easy to find and organize team activities in just a few clicks**, without spending hours searching, comparing options, or coordinating logistics.

## 🧩 What problem does this app solve?

Managers often want to:

- Strengthen team relationships
- Organize offsites, workshops, or team breaks
- Do something different without wasting time planning

Moments solves this by providing a **curated list of team activities**, designed for different team sizes and contexts, and accessible from a single platform.

**Moments** is a discovery experience inside the platform where managers can:

- Browse curated team activities
- Quickly understand what each activity is about
- See what team size each activity is ideal for
- Find activities that fit their team and context

The experience is focused on **speed, clarity, and simplicity**, so managers can go from idea to plan in minutes.
